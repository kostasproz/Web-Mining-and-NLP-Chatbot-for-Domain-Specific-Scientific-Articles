# Web-Mining-and-NLP-Chatbot-for-Domain-Specific-Scientific-Articles
This project created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. It began by web-crawling scientific articles, followed by LDA Topic Modeling for analysis. The final chatbot uses TF-IDF for document retrieval and a GPT-2 model to generate precise, context-driven answers from the source material.
