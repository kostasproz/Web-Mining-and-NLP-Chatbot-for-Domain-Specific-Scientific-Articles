## üìå Project Overview  
This project developed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built on a custom knowledge base of scientific articles. The pipeline began with **ethical web mining** of over 60 articles from *ScienceDaily*, followed by **preprocessing** and **LDA topic modeling** to extract key themes. The final chatbot integrates **document retrieval (TF-IDF)** with **generative AI (GPT-2)** to provide context-grounded, domain-specific answers.

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline** ‚Üí From data acquisition (web mining) to deployment (interactive chatbot).  
- **Topic Analysis** ‚Üí Uses *Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)* with pyLDAvis visualization.  
- **RAG Architecture** ‚Üí Two-step system: retrieve relevant text, then generate fact-grounded responses.  
- **Interactive CLI** ‚Üí Users can query the knowledge base directly in the terminal.
