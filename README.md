Scientific RAG Chatbot with Web Mining üî¨ü§ñProject OverviewThis project created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built on a custom knowledge base. The process began by ethically web-crawling over 60 scientific articles from ScienceDaily, followed by preprocessing and LDA Topic Modeling to extract core themes. The final chatbot leverages a hybrid retrieval and generation approach, using TF-IDF for fast document retrieval and a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate precise, context-driven answers grounded in the source material.üöÄ Key FeaturesEnd-to-End Data Pipeline: Full implementation from data acquisition (Web Mining) to deployment (Interactive Chatbot).Topic Analysis: Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and visualization with pyLDAvis to understand and categorize the corpus.RAG Architecture: Implements a two-step system (Retrieve then Generate) for fact-grounded, domain-specific Q&A.User Interaction: An interactive command-line interface (CLI) for querying the scientific article knowledge base.üõ†Ô∏è Techniques UsedCategoryTechniqueLibrary/ModelDescriptionWeb MiningWeb Scraping, Ethical DelaysBeautiful Soup (BS4), RequestsUsed to collect article text and links from the target website.Feature EngineeringTerm Frequency-Inverse Document FrequencyScikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer)Vectorizes the text corpus for efficient semantic search and retrieval.Unsupervised LearningLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)GensimDiscovers underlying scientific topics within the "Sports" and "Cancer" categories.Generative AIRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)Hugging Face (transformers), GPT-2Connects the retrieved document context to a generative model for final answer formulation.NLP PreprocessingTokenization, Stopword RemovalNLTK, SpaCyStandard cleaning and preparation of raw text data.‚öôÔ∏è Installation and SetupThis project uses Python 3.10+.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/scientific-rag-chatbot.git](https://github.com/your-username/scientific-rag-chatbot.git)
cd scientific-rag-chatbot
2. Create and Activate Virtual EnvironmentIt is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.python -m venv venv
# On Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install DependenciesInstall all required Python packages:pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file from your notebook. The key libraries are beautifulsoup4, requests, nltk, spacy, scikit-learn, gensim, pyLDAvis, and transformers.)4. Run the Analysis and ChatbotThe entire pipeline, including scraping, modeling, and the interactive chatbot, is contained in the Jupyter Notebook.jupyter notebook ITC6008_AnastasovitiKontiLykosMegaritisProzymas.ipynb
Follow the cells in the notebook sequentially. The final cell will start the interactive chatbot loop.üîÆ Future WorkTo further enhance this project for production-readiness, the following steps are planned:Vector Database Integration: Replace the memory-based TF-IDF retrieval with a dedicated vector store (e.g., Pinecone or ChromaDB) for scalable and faster semantic search.Web Application Interface: Implement a simple user interface using Streamlit or Gradio to move the chatbot from the command line to a browser interface.Advanced Generative Models: Experiment with more powerful and domain-specific LLMs (e.g., specialized BERT variants or more recent decoder models) to improve answer quality and factual accuracy.Error Handling and Logging: Add robust logging and better error handling for the web scraping component to gracefully manage changing website structures.
